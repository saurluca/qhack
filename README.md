# qhack
Our Hackathon submission for the Picnic challenge from team Idunno centers on sustainability: an interactive dashboard that helps users track their carbon footprint, budget, and nutrition, alongside a feature that extracts ingredients and recipes from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube links—empowering more sustainable meal planning, waste reduction, and emission control.

## Running the Project

### Recipie Import

Bring Picnic to broader audience, by making it easy to import and share recipies.

- Sharing youtube, tiktok ... videos with recipies to import them
- Share Picnic links with recipies
- To preview the recipe interface, navigate to /recipe on the base URL, and to view the shopping cart layout, use /cart—this mockup will serve as the blueprint for our final design.


### Dashboard

Making it easy to eat healthy, and make sustainable choices,
by showing nutriational values and your carbon footbprint in a dashboard.
