# Q-Hackathon 2025 - Picnic Sustainability Dashboard
This is a submission for the Q-Hackathon in Mannheim 2025. We achieved the second place in the Picnic challange.
For the company Picnic, we created an interactive dashboard that helps users track their carbon footprint, budget, and nutrition, enabling them to make better and more sustainable food choices. Furthermore, we created a tool that extracts ingredients and recipes from videos on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, making meal planning and shopping with Picnic accessible to a broad audience. This is done to make it possible to access a recipe and purchase the necessary ingredients with just a few clicks, directly from a video.

We aim to bring Picnic's sustainable solution to a broad audience, especially the younger generations.

## Running the Project

See [deploy.md](deploy.md)

### Recipe Import

Bring Picnic to a broader audience by making it easy to import and share recipes.

- Sharing YouTube, TikTok... videos with recipes to import them
- Share Picnic links with recipes
To preview the recipe interface, navigate to /recipe on the base URL, and to view the shopping cart layout, use /cart. This mockup will serve as the blueprint for our final design.
