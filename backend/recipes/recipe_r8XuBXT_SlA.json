  "instructions": [
    "Rinse the dried chickpeas under cold water and place them in a large bowl. Add enough water to cover them by at least 5 cm and let them soak for 12-24 hours.",
    "After soaking, drain the chickpeas and rinse them again. Place the chickpeas in a food processor or blender and pulse until a coarse mixture is formed. It shouldn't be a smooth paste, but there should be no large chickpea chunks either. If needed, process in small batches to ensure even mixing.",
    "Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the chopped onion, minced garlic, deseeded and chopped green chilies (if using), finely chopped parsley, and finely chopped cilantro. Mix well.",
    "Add the spices: ground cumin, ground coriander, ground cardamom, cayenne pepper, and salt to the bowl. Stir until well combined.",
    "Add 1 tsp baking powder and 4 tbsp all-purpose flour (or gram flour) to the mixture. Blend well, and let the mixture sit for 30 minutes. If the mixture is too wet, add more flour (up to 6 tbsp in total), one tablespoon at a time, until it is firm enough to form patties.",
    "Prepare a plate lined with a paper towel to drain the cooked falafel patties.",
    "Pour enough vegetable oil into a deep frying pan to reach a depth of about 5 cm. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F).",
    "Form the falafel mixture into small patties with a diameter of about 4 cm and a thickness of about 1.5 cm. Carefully and gently slide 3 or 4 patties into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan.",
    "Fry the falafel patties for approximately 3-4 minutes on one side, or until golden brown. Flip the patties gently and fry on the other side for an additional 3-4 minutes.",
    "Using a slotted spoon, remove the cooked falafel patties from the oil and let them drain on the prepared paper towel-lined plate. Repeat the process with the remaining mixture.",
    "Serve the falafel patties with your choice of pita bread, tahini sauce, tomatoes, cucumber, onion or any other toppings you prefer. Enjoy!"
